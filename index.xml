EEG Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive method to record electrical activity in the brain, which is generated by ionic currents that flow within and across neuron cells. When a large population of thousands or millions of neurons with a similar orientation in a specific brain region synchronises its electrical activity, the produced electrical field is large enough to be observable on the scalp.</description>

      <description>Registration Teams can register by sending a mail to auditoryeegchallenge@kuleuven.be with the names of the team members, emails, and affiliations. Upon confirmation, teams will receive access to the training data.
Guidelines for participants Participants can submit their predictions up to five times. The latest received submission counts as the official score. The Audio-EEG challenge features two separate tasks. Participants can submit to either one track or both. Results should be accom- panied by a 2-page paper describing the proposed method The top 5 ranked teams will be invited to submit a 2-page paper, to be presented at ICASSP-2023, which should be submitted before the camera-ready deadline.</description>

      <title>Task 1: Match-mismatch</title>
      <link>https://exporl.github.io/auditory-eeg-challenge-2023/task1/</link>

      <guid>https://exporl.github.io/auditory-eeg-challenge-2023/task1/</guid>
      <description>Schematic overview of the match-mismatch task Description Task 1 is a classification problem in a match-mismatch paradigm. In this paradigm, three inputs are presented to the model:
a segment of EEG, the time-aligned speech stimulus (match) an imposter stimulus (mismatch) The task of the model is to determine which of the input stimulus segments corresponds to the EEG. The performance metric is the classification accuracy (%).
The input length of all (EEG, envelope) pairs is 3s.</description>

      <title>Task 2: Regression</title>
      <link>https://exporl.github.io/auditory-eeg-challenge-2023/task2/</link>

      <guid>https://exporl.github.io/auditory-eeg-challenge-2023/task2/</guid>
      <description>Schematic overview of the regression task Description Task 2 is a regression problem: To reconstruct the stimulus from the EEG. After reconstruction, a metric to measure the similarity is used between the reconstructed stimulus and the original stimulus. In this task, we use the Pearson correlation.
For this task, the stimulus representation is defined as the envelope, as described in the preprocessing section and as defined by the provided code.</description>

      <description>task 1 Provided test dataset The test data for this task can be downloaded from here. The directory contains following items:
Preprocessed EEG test samples: The main directory contains 84 subjects&amp;rsquo; test data in the format of subject_name.json. Note that there is no test data for sub-001. Each json file contains a python dictionary with sample IDs as keys and tuples in the format of (EEG, speech1, speech2) as values. First element of the tuple is preprocessed EEG of 3 seconds long with fs=64 Hz.</description>

      <description>Challenge Call Various neuroimaging techniques can be used to investigate how the brain processes sound. Electroencephalography (EEG) is popular because it is relatively easy to conduct and has a high temporal resolution. Besides fundamental neuroscience research, EEG-based measures of auditory processing in the brain are also helpful in detecting or diagnosing potential hearing loss. They enable differential diagnosis of populations that can otherwise not be tested, such as young children or people with mental disabilities.</description>
